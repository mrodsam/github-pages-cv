## About me üë©‚Äçü¶∞
Like any good software developer, I am interested in solving problems, looking for appropriate solutions both functionally and technologically. I consider that constant learning is a fundamental aspect in any professional field, but with a much greater impact in the technological one.

Personally I am dedicated, flexible but with clear principles, able to make decisions and work in a team. I also consider myself to be quite the organizational geek. I have tutored at various levels and I spend my spare time reading about good programming practices and learning new technologies applicable to my work or not. For example, I've made some platform games for Android and PC based on Unity.

## Publications and projects üìÑ 
- üìú [Big Archaeological Data: Mining social information about ancient
Mesopotamian civilizations using a graph database built from cuneiform corpora](https://doi.org/10.1109/SMAP49528.2020.9248435) - *2020 15th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation and Personalization*
    
    Thousands of cuneiform tablets have been excavated that contain administrative texts with proper names, job positions, business transactions, names of institutions, etc. Building on preliminary evidence of feasibility achieved by third authors, we present an approach based on a graph database to extract additional information about communities and individuals of Ancient Mesopotamia. This paper explains how we are creating a semantically-enhanced graph, in which individuals appear as nodes and the interactions between them are expressed as connecting labeled arrows, with vocabularies specifically designed to enable deep analysis.

- üß¨	 **MSc Thesis**: *Qualitative analysis through visual interpretability techniques of neural network models for mammography classification.*

    Nowadays, research in the field of artificial intelligence is focusing on the explainability of the 
    developed algorithms, mainly neural networks. This trend is known as XAI and brings certain 
    advantages such as increased confidence in the decision-making, improved capacity for error analysis, verification of results and possibility of model refinement, among others. In this work we have 
    focused on interpreting the predictions of recently developed deep learning models through different visualization techniques. The use case we introduce is the detection of breast cancer through the classification of mammographies, since the medical field is widely benefited by the contributions of XAI methods. Furthermore, the target neural networks are based on recent and poorly explored architectures. These are the Vision Transformer model, built through attention blocks, and EfficientNet, designed to improve the performance of convolutional networks.

- üõ°Ô∏è  **Bachelor's Degree Thesis**: *MACsec in the corporate environment without infrastructure support.*

    At present, it is possible to set up a MACsec security association between two hosts statically. But we want to incorporate in the scenario the MKA protocol (MACsec Key Agreement protocol), specifically designed to dynamically establish such associations. The goal would be to achieve end-to-end encrypted communications (without the need for the intermediate switch to implement MACsec) dynamically.

    - Runner-up prize for best Bachelor's Degree Thesis in the area of cybersecurity (R UVigo-UDC Chair).

- üíä **Bachelor's Degree Group Project**: *PillO'Clock*

    This project arises from the need for supervision and control of medication in patients who require special care, either because of their illness or because they are dependent. What we provide with our pill box is the confidence that the patient takes the corresponding medication at the right time and, if not, the peace of mind that the caregiver will receive a warning message, allowing him/her to take the corresponding measures.
    The proposed solution is an electronic pill dispenser. After filling it, each of the compartments where the medication is inserted remains locked until it is time to take it, at which time it is unlocked and signaled by an LED, while an audible alarm is emitted in the pill dispenser as a reminder.
